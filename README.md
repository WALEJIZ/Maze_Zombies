# Maze Zombies

A Minecraft-style zombie shooter set in a maze. Built with Three.js.

## Gameplay

Navigate the maze, shoot zombies with your gun, find the **janitor zombie** and kill it to get the **key**, then use the key to unlock the **exit door** and escape!

### Mechanics

- **3-Hit System**: Zombies take 3 bullets to kill. On the 3rd hit they **explode** into blocky debris.
- **Chain Explosions**: If another zombie is within the explosion radius, they die instantly from the blast - creating potential chain reactions!
- **Janitor Zombie**: One zombie wears a janitor outfit (blue overalls + cap). Killing it drops the key needed to escape.
- **Exit Door**: Find the exit door at the edge of the maze. You need the key to open it and clear the level.
